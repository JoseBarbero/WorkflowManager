abstract = {The objectives of this study were to identify antimicrobial resistance genotypes for Campylobacter and to evaluate the correlation between resistance phenotypes and genotypes using in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility testing and whole-genome sequencing (WGS). A total of 114 Campylobacter species isolates (82 C. coli and 32 C. jejuni) obtained from 2000 to 2013 from humans, retail meats, and cecal samples from food production animals in the United States as part of the National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System were selected for study. Resistance phenotypes were determined using broth microdilution of nine antimicrobials. Genomic DNA was sequenced using the Illumina MiSeq platform, and resistance genotypes were identified using assembled WGS sequences through blastx analysis. Eighteen resistance genes, including tet (O), bla OXA-61, catA , lnu (C), aph(2 ″ )-Ib , aph(2 ″ )-Ic , aph(2 ′ )-If , aph(2 ″ )-Ig , aph(2 ″ )-Ih , aac(6 ′ )-Ie-aph(2 ″ )-Ia , aac(6 ′ )-Ie-aph(2 ″ )-If , aac(6 ′ )-Im , aadE , sat4 , ant(6 ′ ) , aad9 , aph(3 ′ )-Ic , and aph(3 ′ )-IIIa , and mutations in two housekeeping genes ( gyrA and 23S rRNA) were identified. There was a high degree of correlation between phenotypic resistance to a given drug and the presence of one or more corresponding resistance genes. Phenotypic and genotypic correlation was 100{\%} for tetracycline, ciprofloxacin/nalidixic acid, and erythromycin, and correlations ranged from 95.4{\%} to 98.7{\%} for gentamicin, azithromycin, clindamycin, and telithromycin. All isolates were susceptible to florfenicol, and no genes associated with florfenicol resistance were detected. There was a strong correlation (99.2{\%}) between resistance genotypes and phenotypes, suggesting that WGS is a reliable indicator of resistance to the nine antimicrobial agents assayed in this study. WGS has the potential to be a powerful tool for antimicrobial resistance surveillance programs.},

We describe how WGS has increased our understanding of the evolutionary and epidemiological dynamics of this pathogen and how WGS has the potential to improve surveillance and outbreak detection. We have identified hurdles to the full implementation of WGS in public health settings. Despite these challenges, we think that ample evidence is available to support the benefits of integrating WGS into the routine monitoring of C. jejuni infections and outbreak investigations.},

abstract = {Whole genome sequencing (WGS) is useful for determining clusters of human cases, investigating outbreaks, and defining the population genetics of bacteria. It also provides information about other aspects of bacterial biology, including classical typing results, virulence, and adaptive strategies of the organism. Cell culture invasion and protein expression patterns of four related multilocus sequence type 21 (ST21) C. jejuni isolates from a significant Canadian water-borne outbreak were previously associated with the presence of a CJIE1 prophage. Whole genome sequencing was used to examine the genetic diversity among these isolates and confirm that previous observations could be attributed to differential prophage carriage. Moreover, we sought to determine the presence of genome sequences that could be used as surrogate markers to delineate outbreak-associated isolates. Differential carriage of the CJIE1 prophage was identified as the major genetic difference among the four outbreak isolates. High quality single-nucleotide variant (hqSNV) and core genome multilocus sequence typing (cgMLST) clustered these isolates within expanded datasets consisting of additional C. jejuni strains. The number and location of homopolymeric tract regions was identical in all four outbreak isolates but differed from all other C. jejuni examined. Comparative genomics and PCR amplification enabled the identification of large chromosomal inversions of approximately 93 kb and 388 kb within the outbreak isolates associated with transducer-like proteins containing long nucleotide repeat sequences. The 93-kb inversion was characteristic of the outbreak-associated isolates, and the gene content of this inverted region displayed high synteny with the reference strain. The four outbreak isolates were clonally derived and differed mainly in the presence of the CJIE1 prophage, validating earlier findings linking the prophage to phenotypic differences in virulence assays and protein expression. The identification of large, genetically syntenous chromosomal inversions in the genomes of outbreak-associated isolates provided a unique method for discriminating outbreak isolates from the background population. Transducer-like proteins appear to be associated with the chromosomal inversions. CgMLST and hqSNV analysis also effectively delineated the outbreak isolates within the larger C. jejuni population structure.},

abstract = {In this study Campylobacter jejuni isolates were recovered from birds, carcasses and carcass portions from two broiler chicken flocks and from equipment used for carcass and meat processing along the production chain from farms to retail stores. Isolates were subjected to pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) using SmaI and KpnI restriction enzymes and their antimicrobial susceptibilities were determined. C. jejuni was recovered from product and equipment used with both flocks at each point in the production chain. The prevalence of C. jejuni in poultry products at retail stores was 58.97{\%} (flock 1) and 69.23{\%} (flock 2). SmaI divided 122 C. jejuni strains from flock 1 and 106 from flock 2 into 17 and 13 PFGE types, respectively. PFGE types H and F were present at all steps along the chain, from farms to retail products. Similarly, for both flocks PFGE type D was detected in crates, slaughterhouse and retail stores. Moreover, the PFGE types were highly diverse at the processing and retail steps. Most PFGE types were resistant to ciprofloxacin (95.45{\%}) and tetracycline (81.82{\%}); and multidrug resistant PFGE types were found in the final products. Our study showed that there were several points of cross-contamination of product along the chain, and a high diversity of PFGE types with antimicrobial resistance to ciprofloxacin and tetracycline in the retail products.},

abstract = {Contaminated chicken products have been recognized as the primary vehicles of Campylobacter transmission to human. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and antimicrobial resistance of Campylobacter isolates from fresh chicken products at retail were studied. A total of 512 samples including: thigh, breast, marinated and minced chicken were purchased from different retail stores. Half of the samples were packed and the other half were unpacked. The 39.4{\%} of the samples were Campylobacter positive; being unpacked chicken products (45.3{\%}) more contaminated than packed chicken (33.6{\%}). PFGE typing showed a high diversity among isolates; clustering 204 isolates into 76 PFGE types: 55 clusters of C. jejuni, 19 of C. coli and 2 of C. lari. C. coli genotypes showed higher resistance than other Campylobacter species. Although modified atmosphere packaging can reduce the prevalence of Campylobacter spp., it does not avoid their presence in at least 33.6{\%} of packed chicken products analyzed. Some pulsotypes might persist in the processing plant or butcher shops environment for longer than previously thought. More stringent control measures are needed in previous steps of the chicken food chain, in order to avoid the presence of Campylobacter spp. strains at retail that can compromise consumer's safety.},

abstract = {Campylobacteriosis is the most common cause of bacterial gastroenteritis worldwide. Consumption of poultry, especially chicken's meat is considered the most common route for human infection. The aim of this study was to determine if Campylobacter spp. might persist in the poultry plant environment before and after cleaning and disinfection procedures and the distribution and their genetic relatedness. During one month from a poultry plant were analyzed a total of 494 samples -defeathering machine, evisceration machine, floor, sink, conveyor belt, shackles and broiler meat- in order to isolate C. jejuni and C. coli. Results showed that C. jejuni and C. coli prevalence was 94.5{\%} and 5.5{\%} respectively. Different typing techniques as PFGE, MLST established seven C. jejuni genotypes. Whole genome MLST strongly suggest that highly clonal populations of C. jejuni can survive in adverse environmental conditions, even after cleaning and disinfection, and persist for longer periods than previous thought (at least 21 days) in the poultry plant environment. Even so, it might act as a source of contamination independently of the contamination level of the flock entering the slaughter line.},
